	<h1>Dylan Cianfrone</h1>
	<h3>Welcome to my homepage.</h3>
	<p>
		I'm a 21 year old student currently residing in Centreville, VA. I finished my Bachelor's degree at
		George Mason University in Applied Computer Science with a concentration in Video Game Design in Fall
		2020. I'm now working on my MS in Computer Science at GMU as well as pursuing internship and job
		opportunities. I would love to hear from you, so feel free to send me an email!

		<hr>
		<p>
			At the end of 2020, I was accepted into GMU's Accelerated Master's degree program and began taking my first graduate-
			level classes. I finished my BS in Applied Computer Science with a concentration in Computer Video Game Design in Fall
			2020, so currently in Spring 2021 I've moved on to being a full-time graduate student. I will graduate in Spring 2022
			with my Master's of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Machine Learning.

		<h2>Hunger Games Discord Bot</h2>
		<h5>
			Inspired by the fantastic <a href="https://brantsteele.net/hungergames/disclaimer.php" target="_blank">Hunger Games Simulator</a>
			made by Brant Steele, I'm currently working on a discord bot to take this idea even further.
		</h5>
		<hr>
		<p>
			My main project right now centers around creating a discord bot which will take users from a Discord server and
			simulate a random Hunger Games scenario with them. This project is my way to learn several different concepts at once,
			like basic database usage through MongoDB, lots of practice with Python, and experience the workflow of developing a
			large-scale project on my own start-to-finish.
			<br/><br/>
			Right now, the project is in a very basic prototype stage, but does run and play a super-basic version of the Games.
			The next step in development will be creating the functionality for different types of events, and then writing a bunch
			of different events which will be randomly chosen from to make the experience fresh each time.
			The database is working, but I haven't gotten to a stage where other people are helping me test, so there isn't very
			much populating it. However, this project is my main focus other than school stuff, so I'm hoping to get more progress
			soon! - Github repository <a href="https://github.com/dylancianfrone/hunger_games" target="_blank">here</a>.

		<h2>Automated Random Dance Play for GMU KDC</h2>
		<h5>A small website made to help out my student organization at GMU.</h5>
		<hr>
		<p>
			This was a small project that I put together to help out my school club, the GMU Kpop Dance Club. Random dance
			play videos are a big part of Kpop Dance culture as well as some of our club meetings. It centers around choruses
			to popular songs playing, and anyone who knows the choreography for those songs jumps in and dances to them. Our
			club was running into a problem where it was hard to find Random Dance Play videos online with songs that many people
			in club knew, which made it hard for everyone to be engaged and have a good time.
			<br/><br/>
			This bot pulls from a list of songs I curated, randomly shuffles them, and then for each song, opens a new tab to the
			YouTube video timestamped to the chorus of the song, waits an amount of time I determined for the chorus to last, and then closes the tab. This project
			is sitting on the backburner at the moment, since it's been a long time since our club was able to meet in person and
			actually use it. However, I do have ideas about how to improve it, so it's entirely possible that I'll come back and
			update it someday soon. - Github repository <a href="https://github.com/dylancianfrone/dylancianfrone.github.io/tree/master/kdc" target="_blank">here</a>,

		<h2>Spotify Ranking System</h2>
		<h5>This project will pull artist information from Spotify and let users rank their favorite songs.</h5>
		<hr>
		<p>
			This project was inspired by a trend in the Kpop community where users would rank the discography of
			their favorite artists and share their results on Twitter to compare them with other fans. The problem I
			noticed was that every website made to rank songs, had to have each song by the artist manually added to a
			list before users could use it.
			<br/><br/>
			When this project is finished, a user will be able to find an artist or playlist on Spotify, and sort the songs
			by that artist or in that playlist from best to worst by one-by-one choosing between pairs of songs. Then, users
			will be able to share their results with others quickly and easily. This project is still in very early stages at
			the moment, but I'm using it as an opportunity to learn Node.js and more advanced web design. - Github repository
