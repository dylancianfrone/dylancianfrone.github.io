	<p>My name is Dylan Cianfrone. I'm a 19 year old college student currently attending George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. I'm in my third year at Mason studying Applied Computer Science with a concentration in Video Game Design.</p>
	<p>Since I started playing PC games back in middle school they completely sucked me in for hours and hours at a time. Back then, I was spending all my time on Minecraft and internet flash games. These days, I'm usually thinking about a game, game design, or esports. This passion combined with my knowledge of programming made it clear that the game programming path was the way to go for me. </p>
	<p>Currently, I'm spending the most time on League of Legends and of course watching the world championships. In my classes, we're working on building a game engine and using it to make basic games. I'm using the small amount of free time I have to draft out (and hopefully, soon prototype) my first real game.</p>
	<p>I have a strong preference for <b>object-oriented programming</b>. I started in <u>Java</u>, but since, <u>C++</u> has been my favorite language (though I still do love Java). I also know some <u>JavaScript</u>, a lot of <u>C</u> and a bit of <u>Python</u>, so I'm not just an object-oriented guy. I love to learn and I'm searching for more avenues to learn new languages and techniques!</p>
	<p>While a lot of my friends are into video games, only a couple are into programming at all. A lot of them want to go into more art-related fields like animation and story. I think this gives me a <b>unique perspective</b> in a large team environment. A lot of people on one side of the art-programming dichotomy (at least online) don't seem to have a ton of respect for one another, but I think it's necessary to remember that everyone's work is both extremely important and require a lot of effort. 
	<br/>I really enjoy working on teams with people of different disciplines. Even though I don't really have the skill to rig a 3d model or draw a new character, I think the different ideas that go into these things are extremely interesting and it's awesome to see characters and environments progress over time, just like code. 
	<br/>I'm very good at <b>following directions</b> and making sure my work is the best that it can be. That said, if someone needs to take charge and no one is doing it, I'm not scared to be the one to lead. This combined with my strong communication skills make me an <b>excellent fit for any team</b>.</p>
